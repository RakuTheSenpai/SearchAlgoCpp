# SearchAlgoCpp
A small project about search algorithms and their visual representation.

## Building
You can use and edit the provided make file to suit your needs. Personally I use Linux and the g++ compiler, so that's how it is configured.

## Usage
Using the application is pretty simple, you just need to hover over the tiles and click (like a Ms paint). The only exceptions are the position of the start and goal since they must be a single point.

|Hotkey | Description|
|-------|------------|
|Q | Activates the clear "brush", now you can delete walls where you have draw them.|
|W | Activates the wall "brush", now you can paint walls where you want them.|
|E | Set Start position.|
|R | Set Goal position.|
|T | Generate random maze.|
|C | Clears the grid of any previous performed algorithms.|
|D | Clears the grid along with walls.|
|1 | Perform BFS on Grid.|
|2 | Perform DFS on Grid.|
|3| Perform A* on Grid. |

## Color Code
|Color | Meaning |
|------|---------|
|Yellow|Start/Completed path|
|Green|Goal|
|Blue|Visited|
|Magenta|In queue/stack|
|Black|Wall|
|White|Empty space|
