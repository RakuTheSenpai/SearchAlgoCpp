# SearchAlgoCpp
A small project about search algorithms and their visual representation in C++.

## Building
You can use and edit the provided make file to suit your needs. Personally I use Linux and the g++ compiler, so that's how it is configured.

## Usage
Using the application is pretty simple, you just need to hover over the tiles and click (like a Ms paint). The only exceptions are the position of the start and goal since they must be a single point.

|Hotkey | Description|
|-------|------------|
|Q | Activates the clear "brush", now you can delete walls where you have draw them.|
|W | Activates the wall "brush", now you can paint walls where you want them.|
|E | Set Start position.|
|R | Set Goal position.|
|C | Clear the grid.|
|1 | Perform BFS on Grid.|
|2 | Perform DFS on Grid.|

## Examples (Coming Soon)

## Todo
* Recalculate on goal or start coordinates reposition. 
* Generate walls randomly.
* Expand or substract the number of tiles.
* Clear walls on clear (The C Hotkey).
* Add A*.
